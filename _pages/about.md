Welcome. I am an academic psychologist specializing in education, development and innovative teaching methods. For years, I have been associated with the SWPS University, managing the international psychology degree program, crafting cross-national teaching collaborations, lecturing and supervising numerous diploma theses. 

I offer training in the following areas:
======

- AI use in education (course design, automated assessment, feedback and chatbots, prompting).
- AI use in academia (research, data analysis, script programming).
- Agile Team Based Learning (ATBL), which integrates Team Based learning with an interative, agile prototyping.
